The Help is a historical fiction novel by American author Kathryn Stockett and published by Penguin Books in 2009.
The story is about African Americans working in white households in Jackson, Mississippi, during the early 1960s. 
The Help is set in the early 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi, and told primarily from the first-person perspectives of three women:
Aibileen Clark, Minny Jackson, and Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan. 
Aibileen is a maid who takes care of children and cleans. Her own 24-year-old son, Treelore, died from an accident on his job. 
In the story, she is tending the Leefolt household and caring for their toddler, Mae Mobley. Minny is Aibileen's friend who frequently 
tells her employers what she thinks of them, resulting in her having been fired from nineteen jobs. 
Minny's most recent employer was Mrs. Walters, mother of Hilly Holbrook. Skeeter is the daughter of a wealthy white family who owns Longleaf,
a cotton farm and formerly a plantation, outside Jackson. Many of the field hands and household help are African Americans. 
Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from the University of Mississippi and wants to become a writer.
